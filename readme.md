# The Automagic Manager

Fourth consecutive rewrite of a project that worked fine the first time.
This will be updated with usage instructions when the bot works.

## Recent changes

TODO: Update change log.


## Creating a new instance

When operational, the bot will hang out in the [Narwhals server](https://discord.gg/GyXtwnBWne),
though you're also welcome to [invite it to your own server.]()

You are also welcome to build your own instance of the bot through one of the following options.

### Building from source

TODO: Write build instructions.

### Release package

TODO: Update when releases are available.

---

And in either case, you will need to follow these instructions if you don't already know what you're doing:

- You will need to create an Application on [Discord's Developers page](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
You can do this by clicking the link above and clicking on 'New Application' in the top right corner next to your user avatar.

- Once you have created the application, you will need your bot token from the 'Bot' tab in your app's info page.
Copy this token and then paste it into the `token` field in the `config/discord.toml` file.

- Now you can simply double click on the 'Monitor.exe' file in the root folder and a terminal/console window will open, showing you
the application's logs in real time. (These logs will also be saved in `/.logfile`.)


## Contribution

TODO: Write contribution instructions.

### Mainline development

TODO: Write contribution instructions.

### Extensions

The hope is that by version 1.0, extensions will be supported and creating your own Discord bot through Automan will be
as simple as a few clicks and thinking of a cool name.

TODO: Update with Extensions guide.


## Licensing

The bot is released under the 3-clause BSD license at the repository root.
